Basic Blackjack with a dealer

This blackjack game only has the basic rules of drawing
above 21. It does not include any other characteristics of 
the game as splits, etc. 

This version includes a dealer. The objective of the dealer
is to draw cards until it reaches 17 or above, but if it goes 
above 21, the player wins.

There is a button called "next" which allows you to play
again without the need to refresh the website. Whenever
"next" is clicked, cards are drawn randomly from a virtual deck,
which makes the game a bit more realistic, of course, without
the cards shuffle. 

The "check" button simply shows the amount of each card left in
the deck. This can be seen in the console.
